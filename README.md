🔄 Workflow and Flow Explanation

Step-by-Step Flow:

User opens site on Azure App Service frontend

Uploads a PDF and selects a job role (e.g., Data Analyst)

JavaScript Fetch API sends the resume + selected role via POST to /analyze

Flask backend (app.py)

Receives file via request.files

Extracts text using PyMuPDF

Matches text against keywords from predefined dictionary (JOB_KEYWORDS)

Calculates percentage match and identifies missing keywords

Sends JSON response

Frontend JS receives the response and dynamically updates DOM to show:

Matched role

Score bar

Missing skills

Feedback message and celebration animation (fireworks)

Azure Monitor logs all requests, including any errors (e.g., CORS issues)
